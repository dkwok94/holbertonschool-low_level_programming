# Holberton School Low Level Programming Project

The contents of the following folders are a series of programs that I wrote for a project at Holberton School about low level programming using the C programming language. The programs in this repository were assigned based on prompts given and written by the school staff to accomplish certain tasks. The repository will be updated as more programs and units are added.
