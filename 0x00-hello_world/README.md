# List of Scripts and Programs in This Assignment (C-Hello,World)

**0-preprocessor**
> This script will run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result to another file. The C file name will be saved in a variable called ```$CFILE``` and the output will be saved in the file ```c```.

**1-compiler**
> This script will compile a C file without the linking step. The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE``` and the output file will have the extension ```.o```.

**2-assembler**
> This script will generate assembly code of a C code and save its output into a file. The C file name will be saved in a variable called ```$CFILE``` and the output will have an extension ```.s```.

**3-name**
> This script will compile a C file and create an executable file called ```cisfun```. The C file name will be stored in a variable called ```$CFILE```

**4-puts.c**
> This program will print exactly *"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle* followed by a new line. It can only use the function ```puts``` and must end with a return value of ```0```.

**5-printf.c**
