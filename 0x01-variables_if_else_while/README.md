# List of Scripts for This Assignment (C - Variables, If, Else, While)

**0-positive_or_negative.c**
> This program takes a random number and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero followed by a new line.

**1-last_digit.c**
> The program takes a random number and decides whether the number in the ones place (with the sign of the whole number) is greater than 5, zero, or less than 6/not equal to zero. A newline will terminate the program.

**2-print_alphabet.c**
> This program will use the ```putchar``` function to print the alphabet in lower case followed by a new line.

**3-print_alphabets.c**
> This program will print the alphabet in lower case followed by upper case followed by a new line using the ```putchar``` function.

**4-print_alphabt.c**
> This program will print the alphabet in lower case except for the letters ```q``` and ```e```. Only the ```putchar``` function will be used and it can only be used twice.

**5-print_numbers.c**
> This program will print all single digit numbers in base 10 starting from ```0``` followed by a new line.

**6-print_numberz.c**
> This program will print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from ```0``` followed by a new line. The catch is that we cannot use a variable of type ```char```. This is basically just saying we can put the ```char``` data into an ```int``` data type.

**7-print_tebahpla.c**
> This program will print the lowercase alphabet in reverse followed by a new line. Only the ```putchar``` function will be used and only twice.

**8-print_base16.c**
> This program will print all numbers of base 16 in lowercase followed by a new line using ```putchar``` at most three times.

**9-print_comb.c**
> This program will print all single digit numbers in a comma separated list in ascending order using only the ```putchar``` function at most four times.

**10-print_comb2.c**
> This program will print all digits from ```00``` to ```99```in a comma separated list using the ```putchar``` function at most five times. It will end with a new line.

**100-print_comb3.c**
> This program will print all combinations of two digits in a comma separated list. It will exclude duplicate combinations. Duplicate combinations are things like ```01``` and ```10```. However, they will print only the combination with the lowest value. So ```01``` is printed and not ```10``` in this example.

**101-print_comb4.c**
> This program will print all possible combinations of three digits in a comma separated list. Duplicate combinations will be excluded except for the one with the smallest value. Numbers will be in ascending order and only the ```putchar``` function will be used a maximum of six times. **NOTE: The way I did this the first time was a horrible way of doing it and is worth a rewrite when I have time**

**102-print_comb5.c**
> This program prints all possible combinations of two, two-digit numbers from ```00``` to ```99```. The two numbers will be separated by a space and only unique combinations will be printed (in this case, ```00 01``` and ```01 00``` are the same combination and only ```00 01``` will be printed). The function will use only the ```putchar``` function a maximum of eight times and end with a new line.
