# List of Scripts for This Assignment (C - Functions, nested loops)
## Most of these functions were not allowed to use the standard library unless otherwise specified.

**0-holberton.c**
> This program prints ```Holberton``` followed by a new line using a ```_putchar``` function contained in another file. This was to help us get used to using custom header files

**1-alphabet.c**
> This function prints the alphabet, in lower case, followed by a new line.

**2-print_alphabet_x10.c**
> This function prints the alphabet 10 times in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**3-islower.c**
> This function checks for lowercase characters and returns 1 if it is lowercase and 0 otherwise.

**4-isalpha.c**
> This function checks if the character is a letter and returns 1 if it is a lowercase or uppercase letter and 0 otherwise.

**5-sign.c**
> This function prints the sign of a number. It returns 1 and prints ```+``` if the number is greater than zero, returns 0 and prints ```0``` if the number is zero, and  returns -1 and prints ```-``` if it is negative.

**6-abs.c**
> This function computes the absolute value of an integer.

**7-print_last_digit.c**
> This function prints the last digit of a number and returns the value of the last digit.

**8-24_hours.c**
> This function prints every minute of the day starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

**9-times_table.c**
> This function prints a multiplication table for the number 9

**10-add.c**
> This function adds two numbers and returns the sum.

**11-print_to_98.c**
> This function prints all natural numbers from a number ```n``` to 98 where ```n``` is the starting number. THe numbers are printed in order in a comma separated list. **The standard library was allowed for this particular function**

### Advanced/Optional Script Assignments
### The standard library was allowed for all of these programs

**100-times_table.c**
> This function prints a multiplication table for any number between 0 and 14 inclusive.

**101-natural.c**
> This function prints the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 up to 1024.

**102-fibonacci.c**
> This function prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers starting with ```1``` and ```2``` followed by a new line in a comma separated list.

**103-fibonacci.c**
> This function prints the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers whose values do not exceed 4,000,000. The starting point is at 1 and 2.

**104-fibonacci.c**
> This function prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers. We are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays, tables, or structures.
